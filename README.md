# LHCb_Xic_production
Repository for the LHCb analysis of the production ratio of Xic over Lc baryons, using the pKpi decay modes.

# Description
This repository is focussing on analysing a common decay mode of  two baryons pK- and pi+ over the full dataset provided by LHCb.
This project aims to measure the ratio of production between these two baryons to provide insight into the tendency of a charm-quark to group together with a down-quark rather than a strange-quark.

## Support
For general inquiries open a question on issue tracker.

## Roadmap
This project is ongoing with new PR created on a regular basis. Future outlook focusses on finalising MassFits and sWeights.

## Contributing
Pull requests are not yet welcome. For major changes and ideas, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
